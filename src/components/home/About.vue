            The definition of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) needs to remain quite broad, as it now covers almost all forms of information technology (IT).1 HCI is the study of designing computers and machines so that they best serve their users (i.e. humans). HCI is closely related to the field of User Experience (UX) design and is considered by many to be the forefather of this more modern approach.2

            Despite this common link, HCI differs from the more widely-recognised UX design in that its main focus is academic. Where UX designers will be charged with building new human-focused applications, products or services, HCI practitioners are more concerned with the research. This means HCI is focused mainly on developing empirical understandings of users, which can then help to inform the work of on-the-ground UX designers.3 Thatâ€™s why HCI is the window through which the future of UX can be seen.
